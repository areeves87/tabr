Create guitar tablature ("tabs") from R code with `tabr`. The `tabr` package provides programmatic music notation and wraps around the open source music engraving program, Lilypond, for creating quality guitar tablature.<img src="tabr_logo_small.png" style="float:right;margin:5px;width:400px;">

`tabr` offers functions for describing and organizing musical structures and a wrapper around the Lilypond backend. Lilypond is open source music engraving software for generating high quality sheet music based on markup language. `tabr` generates files following the Lilypond markup syntax to be subsequently processed by Lilypond into sheet music pdf files.

A standalone Lilypond (.ly) file can be created or the package can make a system call to Lilypond directly to render the guitar tablature output (.pdf). While Lilypond caters to sheet music in general, `tabr` is focused on leveraging it specifically for creating quality guitar tablature.

## Installation

You can install tabr from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
