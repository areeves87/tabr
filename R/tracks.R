#' Generate a chord set
#'
#' Generate a chord set for a music score.
#'
#' The chord set is a named list. The names are the chords and the list elements are strings defining string and fret fingering readable by LilyPond.
#' Multiple chord positions can be defined for the same chord name.
#' When defining chords, you may also wish to define rests or silence for chords added to a score for placement above the staff in time,
#' where no chord is to be played, though this will be excluded from the chord set as unnecessary.
#' The chord set list output by \code{chord_set} is only used for top center placement of a full set of chord diagrams for a music score.
#'
#' @param x character, six-string chord description from lowest to highest pitch, strings 6 through 1, e.g., the open A minor chord in standard tuning is \code{"xo221o"}.
#' @param id character, the name of the chord in LilyPond readable format, e.g., \code{"a:m"}.
#'
#' @return a named list.
#' @export

#' @examples
#' chord_names <- c("e:m", "c", "d", "e:m", "d", "r", "s")
#' chord_positions <- c("xx997x", "x5553x", "x7775x", "ooo22o", "232oxx", NA, NA)
#' chord_set(chord_positions, chord_names)

#' Create a music track
#'
#' Create a music track from a collection of musical phrases.
#'
#' Musical phrases generated by \code{\link{phrase}} are fortified in a track table.
#' The default for an additional staff is \code{add_staff = "treble_8"} for 8va treble clef, which is commonly displayed in quality guitar tablature above the tablature staff to include precise rhythm and timing information.
#' Note that guitar is a transposing instrument. For this reason, the default is \code{"treble_8"}, not \code{"treble"}.
#' Set \code{add_staff = NA} to suppress the additional staff.
#' This is appropriate for simple guitar patterns where there are already multiple guitar tracks and the additional space required for two staves per instrument is unnecessary and wasteful.
#'
#' @param phrase a phrase object.
#' @param add_staff add a standard sheet music staff above the tablature staff. See details.
#' @param voice integer, ID indicating phrases belonging to unique voices within a single track. May be a vector.
#'
#' @return a track table.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' x <- phrase("c ec'g' ec'g'", "4 4 2", "5 432 432")
#' track(x)
track <- function(phrase, add_staff = "treble_8", voice = 1L){
  phrase <- tibble::data_frame(phrase, staff = as.character(add_staff), voice = as.integer(voice))

#' Bind track tables
#'
#' Bind together track tables by row.
#'
#' This function appends multiple track tables into a single track table for preparation of generating a multi-track score.
#' Regardless of whether a \code{tabstaff} ID column is present in the input tracks, one is added or the existing one is overridden ensuring a unique integer ID for each track.
#' This is used to separate music staves in the sheet music/tablature output.
#' The actual ID values assigned to each track do not matter; only the order in which tracks are bound, first to last.
#'
#' @param ... track tables.
#'
#' @return a track table.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' x <- phrase("c ec'g' ec'g'", "4 4 2", "5 432 432")
#' trackbind(track(x), track(x))

#' Create a music score
#'
#' Create a music score from a collection of tracks.
#'
#' Score takes track tables generated by \code{\link{track}} and fortifies them as a music score. It optionally binds tracks with a set of chord diagrams.
#' There may be only one track in \code{track} as well as no chord information passed, but for consistency \code{score} is still required to fortify the
#' single track as a score object that can be rendered by \code{\link{tab}}.
#'
#' @param track a track table.
#' @param chords an optional named list of chords and respective fingerings generated by \code{chord_set}, for inclusion of a top center chord diagram chart.
#' @param chord_seq an optional named vector of chords and their durations, for placing chord diagrams above staves in time.
#'
#' @return a score table.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
