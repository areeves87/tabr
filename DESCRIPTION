Title: Create Guitar Tablature
Description: Creates guitar tablature from R code by providing functions for describing and organizing musical structures and wrapping around the Lilypond backend.
    Lilypond is open source music engraving software for generating high quality sheet music based on markup language. 'tabr' provides a wrapper around this
    software and generates files following the Lilypond markup syntax to be subsequently processed by Lilypond into sheet music pdf files.
    A standalone Lilypond file can be created or the package can make a system call to Lilypond directly to render the guitar tablature output.
    While Lilypond caters to sheet music in general, 'tabr' is focused on leveraging it specifically for creating quality guitar tablature.
